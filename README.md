### Building CNN using NumPy for Handwritten Digit Recognition

- Researched **LeNet-5** and implemented the model purely using **Numpy** (Without using TensorFlow, Pytorch, etc.)
- 
- Designed classes respectively for **Convolutional** Layers, **Max-Pooling** Layers, **Fully-Connected** Layers.
- 
- Added **forward** method to each Layer class and get the predictions for the batch using the current weights
- 
- Added **backward** method to each Layer class in which the weights are adjusted based on the loss.
- 
- Recognize over **60,000** handwritten digits in the MNIST and achieved **98.5%** accuracy.
